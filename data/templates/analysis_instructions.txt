## Evaluator TODOs

1. Read the LLM's Input and Output.
2. Evaluate whether the number of extracted obligation is correct.
    [0], if it is wrong
    [1], if correct
2. Evaluate Obligation Type Framework, and replace [X] with:
    [0], if it is wrong
    [1], if correct
3. Evaluate the extracted information according to the following:
    - Extracted value (information itself is correct or not?)
        [0], if it is wrong
        [1], if correct
    - Extraction Method (Is it correct or not to extract using this method?):
        [0], if it is wrong
        [1], if correct
4. In case of more the one obligation structure is identified:
    - There will be one distinct validation space for each obligation.
    - To better distinguish which is which, we presented in the top of each the "Predicate" corresponding to that obligation.
